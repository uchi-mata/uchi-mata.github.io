    Hi! I am an information security enthusiast and practitioner. After more than 15 years in security,
    I am still excited about a broad range of topics (from hypervisors via containers/clouds to IT
    security management/leadership) and have had the opportunity to present on them around the globe.
    Currently, I work on container and cloud security engineering in cloud-native organizations.
    I enjoy the outdoors, martial arts, and spending time with dogs in my free time.
